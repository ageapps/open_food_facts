The above shows the number of food items that are available to those with a certain dietary restriction such as vegetarian, peanut allergies, etc. The open food facts database did not have a lot of data on certain countries such as Greenland and Antarctica, these countries are depicted in grey. The country with the most items available for any dietary restriction is France, except for vegetarian/vegan items. Since the Open Food Facts Database is a French database, there might be some biased to the data collected. For this reason, another map is shown without France's data, this way the other countries' numbers can be differentiated and analyzed better.

By analyzing the map without France's data, we can visually see that neighbouring countries generally have the same food items. First, USA has the most amount of Kosher foods followed by Canada. Then, Canada has the most peanut free foods, followed by USA. Furthermore, the map's filter shows that Halal, Gluten Free, Lactose Free, Vegetarian, and Vegan foods are very popular in the countries surrounding France.
